# NYC_Airbnb_Investment_Project
Analyzing data collected on all Airbnbs in NYC (as of 2023) with the purpose of making recommendations to a potential investor.
Data was imported into a SQL Server relational database as two tables: [NY Airbnb Hosts] and [NY Airbnb Properties]. A number unique to the airbnb host served as a primary key (host_id and id respectively).
